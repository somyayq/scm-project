The front end of a website is everything the user sees and interacts with when they visit the website. It is responsible for the total look and feel of an online experience. The front end is usually handled by professionals such as web designers.
Some examples of front end components include:
Design and markup languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Search engine optimization (SEO)
Usability and accessibility testing
Graphic design and image editing tools
Web performance and browser compatibility
The front end is often perceived that it is technically easier compared to the complexities of back-end development, which requires a solid command over programming languages, Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), and data management skills.
we have created this project to develop skills and be better .
